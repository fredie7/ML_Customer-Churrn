# Customer Churn Analysis and Modeling

Customer churn is a significant concern in highly competitive industries like telecommunications. It refers to the loss of customers who discontinue their subscriptions or services, directly impacting profitability and long-term sustainability. This project explores data-driven techniques to analyze, understand, and predict customer churn using a dataset obtained from Kaggle involving a telecom provider ‚Äì **Telco**.

## Project Overview

This report presents a comprehensive analytical approach to customer churn by leveraging a variety of data science techniques. The ultimate goal is to empower Telco with actionable insights and predictive modeling tools to enhance customer retention strategies.

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to build a **robust machine learning model** that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn. This predictive capability will enable the company to:

- Understand key drivers of customer churn
- Segment high-risk customers
- Initiate timely and targeted retention campaigns
